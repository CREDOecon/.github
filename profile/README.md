## About Credo 

The Catholic Research Economists Discussion Organization (CREDO) is an international society of hundreds of research economists who are interested in the conversation between the Catholic faith and economic research as it applies to the economy, the Church, and broader society.

The idea for CREDO grew out of the existing informal community that had developed around the past conferences on Economics and Catholic Social Thought  sponsored by the Lumen Christi Institute located at the University of Chicago.  Over five years, a large group of economists and other thinkers had been involved and shown interest in these conferences, with a somewhat smaller core of regular participants.  The goal was to institutionalize this community in the hopes that it would grow and increase its outreach.  CREDO was established as a loose email list in the spring of 2013, and officially incorporated and founded in the summer of 2013.

## Our Mission
- To foster a community of Catholic scholars interested in this conversation
- To promote dissemination of economic knowledge and findings into the public discourse of the broader segments of the Church leadership and laity
- To foster awareness and reflection on the principles of Catholic social thought and their relationship to the normative evaluation of the economy
- To help mentor young Catholic research economists or others interested in these areas
- To act as an available resource for competent, non-idealogical, non-partisan economic expertise for Church leaders and organizations engaged in social and economic issues
